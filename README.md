This project is an implementation of an artificial life program: The Boids algorithm, which models the flocking behavior of birds, fish, and other swarming creatures. The simulation is built using **C++** and **SFML** to create an interactive and visually appealing (in my humble opinion) flocking system.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

I will not subject you to a poor man's explanation of this algorithm works, instead I will refer you to the explanations linked in the Contributions section. 
With that said, here is the TL;DR: While this flocking behavior may seem complex at first, it is deceptively simple and emerges from just three basic rules:

1. **Separation** ‚Äì Boids steer away from nearby flockmates to avoid collisions.
2. **Alignment** ‚Äì Boids adjust their velocity to match the average direction of neighbors.
3. **Cohesion** ‚Äì Boids move toward the average position of nearby flockmates.

By combining these rules, realistic swarm-like behavior emerges. Additionally, I‚Äôve introduced the mouse position as a sort of "Predator." The Boids will actively avoid the mouse as they fly around, adding another layer of interaction to the simulation.

## Features

- Real-time visualization of Boids movement
- Configurable parameters for tuning flocking behavior
- Object-oriented architecture for modularity and scalability
- Smooth animations with SFML's graphics rendering
